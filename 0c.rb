#c)	The third method takes in two strings, a first_name and last_name. It will return the first_name concatenated with the 
#last_name, along with a space in between.
#Example:
#combine_name 'Howard', 'Chen'
#'Howard Chen'

def combine_name(first_name, last_name)
	return puts "#{first_name}"+" "+"#{last_name}"
end

first_name = "Kashfia"
last_name = "Rahman"
combine_name(first_name,last_name)
